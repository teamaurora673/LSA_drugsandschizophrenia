NAME,REPORT
RebelTheFlow,"In real life, my friend who hears voices but never got diagnosed with anything committed suicide by jumping off a bridge onto the freeway & then getting hit by car. I went to his funeral which was open casket but shouldn’t have been because dried blood leaked from his ear, his face was swollen and bruised badly despite the funeral makeup to cover all that, and he had sunglasses on to cover the fact that his eyes had popped out. A couple months later, I had my first psychotic breakthrough. I was in class (college) & there were empty seats all around me because many people skipped that day (day after valentines). Suddenly the seats began to fill with faceless blurry people I couldn’t recognize, but they were lead by my friend, the one who committed suicide. His face was disfigured, blood running out his ears, eyes bulging out with tears of blood, pieces of gravel from the freeway lodged into his cheeks, etc. it was terrifying & traumatizing seeing my friend again in such a gruesome matter. He & the faceless crowd were whispering gibberish & occasionally telling me “Join us” (I assume meaning they were telling me to also commit suicide). It was all very scary visually, but the most unsettling part of it, was the fact that he had heard voices too which in theory lead him to kill himself…so why was my first hallucinatory episode directly correlated with someone who also experienced hallucinations!?"
SonderShaman,When I was in college I was trying to go to bed one night and I heard a whole baseball game outside my house. There was an announcer and a crowd cheering but there was no stadium near me. It was very surreal.
9unoia,I’m still struggling with a delusion. I think that there’s spirits attached to me and they’re punishing me because of the bad things I’ve done. Then I would try to tell myself that why would a random spirit care about me. but then sometimes I also believe that time doesn’t exist in other dimensions so spirits can be in multiple places at once and it wouldn’t be too much work for them to torture me. I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY LOL but I keep trying to tell myself it isn’t real. I am on medication and I do have moments where it’s silent.
Less_Entertainer5983,I thought i'd destroyed the sun and all other stars in the universe and that by morning everyone would find out it was me and id be hung live for the whole world to see. The craziest one though was that someone well known(not naming) had technology that could duplictae souls and implant them into my body and at one time i could feel millions of souls all being put into my body and that eventually i would explode and they would all come out and start attacking me
lilbitunstabl,Before meds there was one time I kept seeing my face appear in the faces i was watching on tv and it freaked me out and i started to panic and the words started to get jumbled to the point i couldnt hear anything anymore besides noise and this yellow caution tape started to go around the room telling me it was just my anxiety acting up and to breathe and as soon as i regulated my breathing it went away. Weirdest hallucination I have ever had.
LevelsOfInsanity,"Seeing myself transfered into a clone body. I was in the hospital near a military base, I remember them taking my spine, brain and eyes out of one body, keeping them alive putting them in another and me waking up two days later feeling like all my nerves were on fire and in physical therapy to learn how to walk again. The issue is I was in the hospital for a blood infection that supposedly cleared up while I was asleep."
Smokinland,"I experience verbal hallucinations, yet I see faces subconsciously, if that makes sense? I hear a voice, and imagine the way the voice looks vividly, yet i don’t see it with my eyes. The craziest one was probably when I was 9, a voice telling me to kill my dog, or I’m weak. Actually got trauma from it (told by psychiatrists, im not just using “trauma” for any stressful event). Thanks god I didn’t do anything, but god, it was awful. I remember getting up from bed, just to prove to the voice that I can do it, that I just don’t want to, yet it didn’t stop. I was so scared to tell anyone, because I thought they would judge me and see me as a bad person, and hell, I saw myself as a bad person for it. I got help tho, because of a different event, and after finding more information about psychosis, I started to realize it wasn’t my fault and it doesn’t define me. After years of holding it in, I finally admitted it to my psychologist, and later my psychiatrist. I don’t wanna think what would happen if it was even more intense."
Emergency_Peach_4307,"That time I was staring at a painting my art teacher was talking about. She was talking about how the guy was wearing blue overalls but all I saw was a white shirt. The craziest thing is that I thought it was real and it stayed that was for several minutes, the first time I ever saw a visual hallucination that I genuinely thought was real and STAYED; I saw my teacher had 2 heads once, her 2nd head being where her neck should be; I saw what looked like the boogie man from nightmare before Christmas dancing in the corner of my room. Really funny honestly but still crazy; The last 2 were actually decently recent (last 6 months) and I think my hallucinations are getting worse, which is scary for me"
Vast_Honey1533,"So I brush my teeth and taste and smell vodka tonight, taste it in the pure orange juice that I'm drinking. I havn't drank alcohol in over a year and a half. I play my guitar and the notes seem to detune, maybe it's the strings but it seems instant. Quite stressful. Also feeling a toothache that doesn't even feel real, like it dissapears completely and then just appears again, havn't felt any pain in my tooth all day until tonight and seems to not have a cause, I don't eat sugary foods or anything and my teeth don't normally hurt, though I do have some dental issues with broken teeth at the back of my mouth, they don't cause pain, just broken wisdom tooth and the pain wasn't there at all, then appears, then dissapears, then appears. Also been feeling other phantom pains that don't seem to have any cause whatsoever. Also quite stressful. Along with some intrusive irritating feelings, anger that isn't mine, like I don't feel angry at all and I'm calm, but I can feel that feeling there for some reason. Quite stressful. I do feel other feelings at the same time, happy, calm, warm and relaxed, but the angry feeling is there too, I try to ignore it."
"Fuckredditsohardtime
","I see animals, not always correctly colored like one time a green ocelot. I also visually hallucinated people I spent a lot of time with like my co worker since we worked 50-60h a week. Finally I would see things dripping, clear colorless drops. Which is scary AF when you work in a chem lab and you don't know if something is dripping something dangerous. I've worked with some very toxic and corrosive stuff."
[deleted],"I see and hear so much shit every day that it's hard to pinpoint a ""most common"" one, I'm basically always hallucinating. But if I need to pick one I think it has to be the faces/upper bodies that peek at me around corners. Any corner is good enough, even if nothing could actually fit behind it. I hate it and it happens all the time. The faces are always so fucked up and detailed and they're always leering at me, their smiles are too big, their eyes are too big. It's a nightmare."
Jayna333,"It depends on the amount of stress I’m feeling. And I’m always feeling a little stressed so there’s usually something that pops up but it varies. On the less scary scale are black geometric shapes, people who suddenly appear and disappear, knocking, stomping, digging or scratching in the walls, and whispering. On the more scary side, there are voices who tell me to stab my eyes out, “angels” telling me to cut my face, bugs crawling underneath my skin, hallucinations of people making distorted angry faces at me, delusions like people are following me, out to murder me, etc. thoughts of suicide, intrusive thoughts about killing a loved one or stranger."
turtlehatchet,"Any shadowy corner in my room is filled with snarling dogs that froth at the mouth and snap their jaws. I wake up to the tactile hallucinations of them not being in their corner anymore since the room is dark and they breath on me and I feel drool sometimes. When I'm in public I can't see peoples faces properly, their features constantly shift and it causes me intense anxiety so I avoid eye contact. I carry something soft and comforting to focus on. My main auditory hallucinations are someone yelling my name to make me snap awake. Sometimes I hear people whispering around me, always negative things about me, and I get scared wondering how they know."
[deleted],"I do rarely have smell ones, it's really weird, they align with whatever delusion is present at the time. But normally things are predominately auditory and visual. Voices coming from over my shoulder, across the room, or behind a door, knocking, screaming, calling my name, telling me to hurt myself, telling me everyone hates me and everything bad about me. Alarms, radio noise, and phone ringtones. Visually I see things like mice or bugs crawling on me. I see a pet dog which I don't mind. When it's more intense I'll also see shadow people or faces. I'll see distorted versions of people and also my reflection moving independently which scares me the most. I've intermittently experienced hallucinations of all 5 senses (and, I guess, some other forms that might not fall under such as they're contained in my head entirely) but the main two are tactile and auditory. These two seem like they'd be common for ANYONE. I feel small touches and itches countless times a day along with deeper muscular fasiculation. I only occasionally ""hear voices"" and I don't consider those auditory as it feels like it is in my head rather than coming from my ears ability to hear but I'd mention I almost incessantly ""mis hear"" my own voice and have progressively formed habit of identifying these tones/inflections as psueodo identities. Oddly, I'm not actually dissociated. I'm not suffering from a dissociative disorder of any kind. I simply am noticing auditory hallucinations and other factors into an apophenic melting pot of impossible stupidity regarding spirits and such... because WHY WOULDN'T I DISSOLVE MY OWN EGO WITH THE SEMBLANCY OF GHOSTS/SOULS? Oh... sorry... I'm a man of logic. That'd be why I'm trying to emphasize how annoying these ""things"" seem as they try to build their own nuances and backstories into my skull like they actually are real."
seasofGalia,"My first visual hallucination was orange and green flames everywhere. That was like a decade ago. Like three years ago, it was men with guns, white vans, and an old lady with a shopping cart. Now, I mainly see beetles and eyes everywhere"
Tibtoubtib,"I have had all kind of hallucinations, including visual. they can be in really bright colors or shadowy. I have seen people I know that way (who are dead or alive) and all kind of stuff like bats around my head, angels, 2 little boys, etc. When I'm not in psychosis with delusions, I can tell those are hallucinations. but I can also hallucinate things that look so real : a cigarette that desappear right when I try to grab it for exemple. my debilitating brain can trick me even more : I can see all the people surrounding me with black glasses and changing faces, or all the people around me looking aggressively towards me, and I can even hallucinate a conversation with somebody. In that last case, it's visual + auditory hallucinations : it's like someone was truly saying something to me while in reality, they said something very different. It's very scary because I can't tell the difference between a real conversation and a hallucinated one, and if I don't answer accordingly to whay they really said, I look very crazy."
nicsickdog,"Visual hallucinations are my worst symptom, I've gone years with no voices and only visual hallucinations. They started off as the typical shadow people in the corner of my eye, but then they started darting across the room. I used to see so many horror movie characters despite never watching any horror movies, babadook, the girl from the ring, slenderman. They used to talk to me too so I have hallucination LORE, backstories and everything. They can chase me around and tap on my shoulders. Pretty vivid but if I stare at them head on they quickly move to the corner of my vision."
Svokalaris,"I usually get a few visual hallucinations. Before starting meds I used to see eyes everywhere, especially on the walls, following me and watching me. The walls would also often melt, almost flesh-like but it would be inky. After starting meds, its not all fully gone but the ones that stayed are large shadow men/figures that constantly poke out from behind doors or they just stand behind a window, glass, or in mirrors, just watching me. I also see this disproportionate humanoid figure that has no face, no facial features, and it somehow makes this weird clicking+whisper sound. The worst is when that figure decides to loom over me/my bed when im trying to sleep. I also hallucinate people constantly staring at me, even if their heads turn/rotate to impossible/unnatural angles (like an owl). Makes it a struggle to go out but I still do anyways. But the most debilitating is when my mind gets confused(?)/convinced(?) that whatever I dreamed/daydreaed was an actual memory, or a vision into the future, etc."
JustWings144,"I regularly have visual hallucinations and they look like they are real. I honestly can’t tell the difference other than reading the situation/location I’m in and the likelihood of it being there. Lately I have been seeing a lot of birds. Birds smacking into the window and killing themselves, bald eagles screeching and circling above me. When they are above me they even cast shadows on the ground that I can see. When I’m going through full blown psychosis, I blackout as a person, but can remember very vividly all my hallucinations. I’m in a completely different world that looks real. That scares me the most because I can’t tell where I am or what is going on or the difference between what is real and what isn’t. It is not safe for me or anyone else. I hate it. I’m new to this and I’m still learning how to deal with it. I hate having to pick feeling absolutely nothing and experiencing no pleasure being on APs or constantly having to scrutinize my environment mentally in terms of likelihood of objects existing. It’s exhausting."
ProfessorSharkteeth,"These are my experiences of what I perceive as hallucinations over the years. What are your experiences? Audible. Hearing my voice called externally to catch my attention. Sometimes I hear people saying things without their lips moving that can get me in trouble as they say things like ""Seems he's stupid"" or ""c***"". They claim never to have spoken when challenged. And I feel a right dick haha! Also I hear every sound in an episode and use my cats to keep me on terra firma. I'm not sure who's more scared, me or them lol! Audible. Hearing whispering that seems to be somewhere between thoughts and a voice (the loudness increases with intensity of episode), but they're not my thoughts they just appear suddenly (used to think it was telepathy), like from inside my brain on the right hand side. This is usually derogatory like a running commentary. E.g. My thought or even talking out loud to someone: I hope he gets better. Other1: No you don't. Other2: He's evil that's why. Other1: I know he is, you know you are, you want him dead. Me (inner monologue): No I don't. Other1: Liar. Other2: He is a liar you know. I try to keep busy working and ignore this shit and I can keep them at bay. Listen to music etc. They're like a fucking grand jury trying to gang up on me. I'm winning the battle I feel. 3. Visual. Eyes open. Seeing faces in ceiling/walls/anything that can often blink or move subtly. Seeing shadows in corners. Feeling presence of the dead around me, worse on a night. 4. Visual. Eyes open. Only happened 2-3 times so not too troubled by this. Seeing actual dead people in the room coming to get me. 5. Visual. Eyes open. Suddenly I'm either (in my mind's eye) somewhere completely different like a cut scene in a game/movie or a different scene plays out in the place I'm at in real life. This scene seems to last a while but probably only a split second and involves strong violence usually. Then I'm back in reality so to speak and everything goes on as before. These are disturbing but after many years I'm battle hardened to it. 6. Visual (Eyes closed). White lights swirling to form faces. Faces where light grey swirls merge together to form a face that disappears. I can travel into tunnels like on a journey through space and time. This can sometimes look like the northern lights. I've spoken with God like this and it was both euphoric to the point of pure bliss and terrifying. 7. Smells. Always smelling car exhaust fumes, gas, methane and raw sewage for some reason. I once had bananas which was nice haha! 8. Bugs crawling through my body and over my body. Haven't had this for 10 years thank fuck. 9. Visual again. Straight lines appear curved. Faces are distorted. Unfortunately this is now a permanent feature even outside psychosis. Which sucks big time. 10. Taste. I can taste metal on and off."
GeneralMaximum5418,"I would get scenes or pictures thrown into my head of people standing at the corner and leaning out to watch me or other stuff like me beating up my dog or sth. Like that. But at the same time my eyes cant see a person watching me and so on. Its crazy i thougt i might be just stupid or making it up for whatever reason. Except these: Visual: Shadow people, visual snow, faces as described, seeing things at the corner of my eyes, people appering or disappering random. Rooms being tilted for like 40 degree, Things getting bigger and bigger or smaller and smaller
Auditory: Noises like steps, baby screaming, knocking., Words or a sentence before the voices go mute., Gibberish(cant understand what they say) I also have very loud thinking, the thoughts act the same way like hearing, but i know they are in my head and disguise as thoughts. Thats a topic thats too complex to describw, because that are not my thoughts. Clockwork, beeping and my tinnitus i constantly have for 3 years now. Body: Bugs and worms crawling in my brain, underneath my skin on my skin or in other parts., Feeling things underneath my skin like microchips or other stuff that isnt there. Delusions: That list would be long, because i mostly have delusions and bugs/worms crawling. But here are some of my identified delusions, or at least i think they might be delusions, i guess a few of them are not so its just a list of things i could consider being a delusion but in not sure: insects and worms in my food, People hear my thoughts, People put thoughts in my head, insects in and on the body, worms in the brain, I am god or devil, there are people in the walls, small microphone on or in my body, Cameras in the walls or in mirrors/windows, GPS chip or something else in my body, blades and saws come out of cracks and tears to kill me, people/police are after me and hiding. Meds or food or other stuff are poisoned"
ElasticFractals,"Personally I hear voices 90% of my day. It's only a small handful of friendly characters now. I've had the illness for about 7 years and throughout the early days I used to have delusional feelings of a sort of reactive feeling that they are an outside intrusive force. But thankfully, I never let those feelings set permanent roots. I think those delusional thoughts were just the minds way of trying to make sense and associate externally, because it's not equipped to handle sensory input like that."
252780945a,"I have two internal voices, one of which is difficult to deal with, the other, mostly, I just know is there. But when I have audio hallucinations it's usually low angry mumbling, distant screams, music, or a tv on somewhere I can't find. If I'm depressed or stressed it happens more. My brain hears existing sounds, like the filter on my aquarium or a quiet radio, and alters them. I end up listening to a lot of angry sounding voices mumbling unintelligibly or screams. Or like a disturbing talk show almost? Like if rush Limbaugh were on in the next room. This morning my girlfriends phone alarm went off and I kept hearing it for an hour. I went up twice to check on it. It all just kind of makes me agitated and then I get flustered and can't figure anything out. I try and limit background noise and I don't listen to music anymore, because that activates the hallucinations. Idk, it's frustrating."
darkfireice,"Luckily for me, mine usually only occur (or become an issue) when I'm severely sleep deprived and exhausted, and during the event I perceive people rapidly approach me. But as I've a had to deal with these since early childhood, I've become proficient at breaking down what I perceive versus what may be real, and so I've been able to breakdown that mostly they are random shapes that my mind interprets as people (likely from pareidolia), but when I was younger it was terrifying animal attacks (ironically I'm find my psychopathic parents beating, when I fled into thier room at night, actually aided attempts to differentiate my perception from ""reality."")"
AliveAcaneofnothing,"I see wild animals attempting to attack me in my home, i be freaking out i just hide in the bathroom and lock the door, my family doesn’t understand what be going on like today i saw a hyena walking towards me growling while i was in the living room so i ran to the bathroom and locked the door 🥲"
-Starbunny-,My vision is so bad that without my glasses everything looks too vague and blurry that I don't even distinguish most of my hallucinations. Most of my hallucinations are shadow people so they just blend right in to all the other shadows and colors. It's actually a tactic of mine to not wear my glasses if I'm having symptoms and it actually helps a lot of the time.
Suzina,"I was diagnosed schizophrenic with delusions but no hallucinations. Hospitalized many times. One of the times I was delusional, it lasted for years. Other times it would last until I got a good night's rest at the psych ward and pumped full of meds. They don't know what to make of me so I more recently got schizoaffective dissorder. My age of onset was typical of a female for schizophrenia, so there's that. I'm homeless now, typing from the library. I have not taken any meds for the last year and have had no symptoms that I am aware of. (no delusions, no hallucinations). So it's nice to be symptom free without meds, but yeah I don't know what to tell you. Whatever it is, it is a thing. I don't know if it will ever come back in my case, but a lot of my 30s were spent in and out of the psych ward. One trick I discovered while delusional is that I am very good at putting myself in other people's shoes and understanding their perspective and loving them, even if we disagree. With delusions it was tough because I couldn't understand another person's perspective. Like ""what do they get out of doing this? Why me? Why would they lie about it? I don't get it"". That feeling tended to indicate it was not a real person that I was experiencing but my delusional concept of said person. I am sorry you are suffering. I don't know if my diagnosis is right either, but it was definitely a problem for me for a while. A big problem. And it destroyed my marriage and now I'm homeless and no family member wants me to come live with them. I hope your story turns out with a more happy ending. Mine isn't over yet, but there's not much good in my life at the moment except that I'm pretty stress free and delusion free."
CaptainCrackedHead,"I had a psychosis a year and a half ago, I've since been on antipsychotics. I'll occasionally hallucinate, and it's been getting a bit more frequent, but no more than once a day. My doctor put me on a new antidepressant recently and it gave me such intense anxiety last night that I started to experience several auditory hallucinations. Some inanimate sounds, others voices. I'm mad at my doctor about something and don't feel comfortable telling him, but I shouldn't keep it a secret from him right? I think I experienced a couple auditory hallucinations today, but I'm not sure. I'm worried that this might be a sign that I'm slowly slipping back into psychosis."
lostLD50,"Ocassionally in the middle of the night I'll get woken up by a strange sensation then gradually start to see images that I can't really make out but the feel like they're coming from my subconcious and it's trying to communicate to me. After it built up to a cresendo I decided I needed to do something about this and started directly addressing the listening part of me and trying to identify its feelings (my feelings that I generally supress). It calmed down pretty quickly once I paid attention to it and I felt a wave of relief as well as a curiosity about what my listening self had to say. I got a few things from it, one which I felt challenged by is that I don't want to be in a long term relationship with my partner, I don't like the future I see with her. This is very hard to deal with, acknowledging that I am deeply scared in general about the future was rewarding but the idea of leaving this relationship feels unmanagable. It felt true though so I can't really deny it's what I want. Whether what I want is what's good for me is hard to tell."
shadowpunkz,"I suffer from paranoid schizophrenia and...to be honest im just afraid to tell my doctor i have tactile hallucinations. Why? Because (shame on me) i resorted to violence on my first paranoid attacks...and that means i was put in a ""compulsive treatment"" (forced to be injected with a specific vaccine every month, or else i would be put in mental institution) This compulsive treatment lasted for 5 years and it was the worst 5 years in my life because of the side-effects that came with it (example: inability to feel dopamine, erectile dysfunction, no orgasm etc) The compulsive treatment is over now and i am finally FREE to take a different medication at home and on my own. Dont worry i take my pills everyday, i know im sick and i need them. BUT When i changed to this new medication without the HELLish side-effects...i now have...Tactile Hallucinations. Any tips on what i should do? If is not clear yet the reason why im afraid to tell my doctor is because i was somewhat ""chemically castrated"" for 5 years.....and this new pills im taking are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! in every way and im finally happy!!!! But......tactile hallucinations :D lol, what do?"
Dumb_and_also_Gay,"Walls swirling - this is especially bad on drywall. The wall in front of me looks like it is swirling around all over itself, it’s hard to describe, but it’s like a more mild version of those videos on YouTube that make you trip The room is a boat - it’s like the whole room is rocking back and forth, as if I where laying in a boat. It comes with a weird physical sensation, but I can’t tell if i can feel the room rocking or if my body is just trying to go with what my eyes see Blurriness/hyper-detail - this ones hard to explain, it’s not like blurriness when I take my glasses off, it’s just that certain objects themself are blurring. example: my knit tights currently look a lot less textured and fuzzier than I know they are. The opposite happens too though where an object will look way more detailed than usual. example: there’s a towel in my room, I can see every individual fiber and every shadow with such vibrancy Everything looks not quite right - I know I keep saying they’re hard to describe but this one is the hardest. It’s like I look at an object, and the object doesn’t have anything different about it than usual, but something about the way it looks just screams that it’s not real. This one played really poorly with a really bad delusion I had in the past that I was in some sort of alien prison simulation Color vibrancy - colors just really pop some times, there’s a painting in my room I’ve looked at a thousand times but right now it looks like the reddest red I’ve ever seen
strobe lights - when I’m in a very dark room, my vision is just assaulted by these flashing white lights, they’re really rad and overwhelming sometimes so I try to have the light on as often as I can. I have a friend who’s epileptic and it always makes me think about how terrible it would be to be epileptic and have that hallucination So yeah I know no one probably cares but these are the hallucinations I see most frequently/right at this second. I’d love to hear if y’all experience any of these as well or if not what you experience, idk"
ManicMaenads,"Not initially, I have to perform reality checks. A common situation for me is to walk into a room, and see other people ""walking at me"" like they're going to bump right into me - and I flinch and shut my eyes, or move to the side. There's never anyone actually there - I'm alone in my apartment. But coming from around a corner and into a new room, I don't think that at all - I think ""oh shit"" and move out of the way. Or if I hear overlapping voices, it takes a few moments to establish if it's an ""inside"" voice or ""outside"" voice - outside being a real person, either my neighbours or the TV or my partner in the other room. I'll try to ""source"" the voice before giving it too much thought, so I can dismiss it as hallucinatory if that's the case. Sometimes I know the voices aren't ""real"" and I engage anyways, I know I'm not supposed to (according to therapists) but it makes me feel better to at least be like ""stop"" ""go away"" ""not right now I'm busy"" and I feel like that keeps me in the moment and grounds me in reality."
aztects17,"90% of mine - I can realize aren't real. Mine are of Jesus's Father Elohim and Jesus taking to me, but don't do it often when I'm out and about daily life. I do struggle with at night when I'm laying down Heavenly Father admitting his understanding for me not living up to a saintly life of Christ though. Sometimes it's hard to measure what's real and not. I'm LDS (Mormon) and served a mission for my church 20yrs ago and was taught to listen for the whispering of the holy Spirit. So that's been engrained in me. But I've grown with dissatisfaction for Mormon Jesus and going to become Catholic with my wife to see what more they can ask of me."
schizofuqface,Bodies hanging from trees. Dead baby in the bin. I was around 16
Yattiel,"I thought my dreams were from the future, that people could talk to me telepathically, and that I was part of a grand prophecy.."
SafeRegret402,"I definitely had hallucinations before this, but I distinctly remember being a senior in high school and popping open a spider bite (ew, I know) and seeing small bugs crawling out of the wound. I was so freaked out by them because they were so small and almost transparent, and google wasn’t showing me anything that proved they were real. The infection had spread across my whole thigh but seeing the bugs come out is what finally made me go to the doctor lol"
1draw4u,"Oh no the very first one was a friend doing duck noises. He did some duck noises but then continued talking normally, while I still heard the duck noises."
bhavnanahata,It started with visual hallucination with me. I had seen myself in mirror with half side of my face completely withered and white hair and the other half as normal. That too in the middle of night. I was damn scared..
tinybeansrule,Seeing tiny bugs crawling all over my home and my hands and arms
someolive2,"hearing ""bugs "" in my pillows"
Whollyaman,My hallucinations were trying to tell my I was psychic like Psyduck and they or myself (I can't remember which) started yelling Psyyyyduck! And going Psyaiyai in his voice like he does when he's confused.
BrightonPhoenix,I once saw the face of Adolf Hitler rendered in Pixar style in the leaves of a tree. He was furious and it was hilarious.
BrightonPhoenix,"Another time, during my first major episode when I was terrified for my soul and wondering ‘where is God?’ Some little voices chimed in “Don’t worry phoenix, you still have Odin, the Allfather” which seemed kind of funny/absurd in one way and very comforting in another, though I was still absolutely terrified. Later that evening, I also had one voice say to me “So, Phoenix. You will be familiar with the Ancien Regime?” Which was kind of puzzling, but again, somewhat absurd."
MoonMacabre,"It’s not just voices for me, they touch me in my lower privates even when I beg them to stop. They say disgusting things to me while they’re touching me and it feels like r*pe. I seriously can’t take it anymore it makes me want to kill myself or cut off the lower half of my body so they can’t touch me anymore.
Does anyone else experience this? They say they do it to hold power over me, just like r*pe… what on earth am I supposed to do?"
Rivas-al-Yehuda,"I had terrible bodily sensations too. The voices threatened me with rape and caused pain in my rectum that was very realistic. They are still very vocal, but they haven't been able to cause physical sensations since I've gotten on anti-psychotics. "
camclemons,"I smelled toxic chemicals, ammonia, burning, cigarette smoke, all sorts of stuff"
[deleted],"This could sound weird, but i could smell like some sort of vinager, later i realized, that's how a corpse smell like. Just for you to know, when i studied in my university, they send us to a room (i don't remember how it was called, it was like a morgue), where they show us a body. It was part of my neuroanatomycal class. So that's when i realized the smell."
tributetotio,"I dunno about strangest, but I would ""smell"" poison fumes thinking people were poisoning me"
[deleted],I get a really awful chemical/burning smell often.
FvckinWalkinParadox,"This is not related to olfactory but some other hallucinations for me were: The most strangest one is thinking that my ex who was halfway across the world would find me and rip my body to pieces, alongside killing my entire family. We are no longer together, after the breakup, my psychosis got worse and that thought came to mind. It lasted for 3 months. The second one was thinking that I was pregnant, bought pregnancy tests and everything. Woke up the next, went straight to the bin to make sure the test didn't change. Thought that my sister wanted to poison me, I didn't eat for 3 days."
Dropmycroissant9,This just happened to me for the first time last week. I kept smelling sewage and I convinced myself I was rotting from the inside out. I’m obviously fine now 🙂
Berri_ari,"I experienced it . I thought it was my husband spirit doing it with me. It was mainly with fingers but I felt penetration. The husband was a voice in my head and at a time I thought we were communicating telepathically,(he was not real, maybe a spirit idk). At the time I thought I was a psychic speaking with different spirits and we perform an “ancient” ceremony Which was me getting different plants from the mountain and performing a ritual of cleansing my room with the pine straw stuck with a stick and got married in the spirit world. I’m still unsure if it was a spirit, a demon, or just my fingers but it felt amazing like something was there. This happens like three times and a sensation that I never felt before, and I’m like oh this is what sex feels like. I’m not religious but I believe in God and that the spirit world is real. Also I smelled too, but it was a cheese smell, which was unpleasant and later on it was discovered that it was actually a demon masquerading as a psychic human (my delusions). But never during inter course it was like a random smell that happen about.
If my words do not make sense it’s cause a lot happen and I feel it was real and I have a problem getting my points across. But all that stopped once I asked God for help."
"[deleted]
","Used to have really bad stuff happen to me too. Like a penis penetrading me and felt c** inside of me. It was so upsetting. Felt raped by it almost every night. Also in some rarer cases, I felt like I had male parts down there and was having sex with a woman or even two women. It was F**** up!
So glad I am not alone on this. And, on top of all this, hear two voices (women) saying they want to have sex with me and they still think I am a guy even though that was a long time ago when I used to be transgender."
baddestaliveohim6996,I thought I had sex with a ghost before
[deleted],"Tactile and auditory are most common for me. Bugs, feeling something move around in my body and push my intestines around, voices. Visual are also pretty common just not quite as much. I see bugs and my cats and distorted looking human figures/shadows. I also tend to see “phantom notifications” where as I look back at my phone a notif banner slides up but when I go to check it, what do u know im still unpopular lol"
CourtM092,I hear voices mainly telling me to kill myself
InterestingKiwi5004,"I hear voices talking down on me, seeing shadows and insects, ghosts and whispers"
Perfect_Difference15,"Mine is gangstalking but they're fucking morons and it's hard not to talk back. I'm sure my mind made them stupid just to get a reaction out of me and make me look like an idiot 😑
Edit: Each of my visual hallucinations have been wildly different from each other. From swirls and fractal overlays to bugs growing out of the ground and solid, grotesque monsters. Sometimes I was surprised that certain hallucinations even exist in the first place."
whatarethosehah,"Shadow people, insects, animals, eyes and faces everywhere and ghosts (not like in the movies, just some white form of energty kinda that moves like a ghost)"
Koncubus,"My first ones I think were either shadow people or semi transparent people (that child me formed a grandiose ghost delusion about). Not sure which one was first, but the shadow people are more common and persistent buddies. I hate the insect ones so much. Honestly, I enjoy the animals (unless I'm driving). I've grown more in different on the eyes and faces. They used to freak me out as a kid though. I've had children running around my room mostly trying to stay hidden while screaming, laughing, and/or crying and it's really really overwhelming. I have an actual old man hallucination that is linked to my c-ptsd and disturbs me greatly. I try the hardest to ignore him."
Lt_Skull,"Faces in everything, lots of head chatter, weird textures (example cloth appears to have a metallic finish) voids in the corners of objects that feel like they go somewhere else. The awareness of people following me and horrid dreams that get perceived in times that can span weeks."
ilhsfm123,I hallucinate a lot of bugs and shadows. I have a lot of auditory. And smelly hallucinations.
EnterJohn,"Tactile and auditory, I usually get the sensation of bugs crawling on me and auditory wise I’ll get people that I know saying my name in public or when I’m by myself"
Silver_D_Golden,"Mine often weaponize things I enjoy like musicals, history, the paranormal, and horror media. I will see things that resemble monsters from horror films or I’ll hear a song from a musical etc etc"
Knife__Boy,Mine are mostly voices. At one point it was only one person but as of late its been 4 people. Seeing people in the corners of my eyes and bugs in my skin have happened too.
gamaale,"Mostly auditory, like there is a radio in the next room. Learned to live with it but it bothers me sometimes."
wonderlandisgone,"Cats meowing in vents, bugs crawling on my arms out of the corner of my eye, people whispering, people walking past in my peripheral but I can’t really see them, whispering yelling my name or “HEY!” Really loud in my ear, knocking"
rhymesayeth,"Mostly auditory, people plotting against me with violent torture plans. Sometimes visual with tons of writing and scribbling on the walls and entire scenarios I participate in that don't make sense but are linked to the violent auditory ones that make me feel like killing myself just to escape it. That's when I check interview a psych ward to adjust my meds and avoid doing any harm to myself."
Anonshortylo,My bf hallucinates ppl and thinks I’m cheating on him with all of them. And he won’t let me break up with him. Seriously feel like I need to get a restraining order at this point but he’s not violent so probably won’t happen.
peonypart,"i get physical hallucinations and audible and visual. and yuck, the physical ones scare me so much. like i’ll be all alone and then it’ll feel like there’s bugs in my skin or like someone’s touching me 🤮"
"
whatrutalkinbout","My visual hallucinations include shadow people, bugs, and oddly specific the little girls (well only one) from the shining. My auditory are most common and it’s voices talking amongst themselves who only occasionally speak to me."
[deleted],"Mine are all of the hallucination types but the most common are auditory, visual, and tactile. I have trouble telling if the visual ones are real or not and the auditory I can usually point them out because they are somewhat muffled. It is harder to tell in public. I do not like whispering unless it is a whisper that I can recognize in ASMR in a controlled setting and environment. I cannot tell if a whisper is real or not and believe they are dangerous in public settings. For tactile hallucinations I mostly feel people touch me inappropriately and bugs on my skin. I was assaulted a few times and was grabbed by the neck in some of those cases and whenever someone touches my neck I have a panic attack. My hallucinations touch my neck and it is uncomfortable but not as intense as someone actually touching me. For some time I was hallucinating people who were abusive to me and believed they were going to get me again. I still hallucinate them and believe they are reading my thoughts and trying to harm me but not as often. Now I hallucinate people judging everything I do, telling me to do stuff, insults, screaming, inappropriate language, violence such as torture, murder, weapon sounds, and paranoid thoughts for most of my auditory hallucinations. I also constantly hear music playing and when I stop listening to a song I still hear parts of it playing. For visual I see disturbing figures and shadows standing in different places and believe they are real until they disappear unless a delusion is making me believe it is real even when gone. I am legally blind so it makes it even harder to tell what is real. I know it is not just my vision because these hallucinations are there constantly and are in different spots of my vision changing positions and looks. I have a bunch of phobias but mostly severe nyctophobia due to the fear of being alone and attacked since I have been locked in dark rooms at times and my hallucinations are very loud and out of control in the dark and it triggers panic attacks and severe delusions. Whenever people sneak up to me I get scared and jump. If I hear screaming I have a panic attack because I had episodes that caused me to do and experience things that hurt me. I was abused as well and bullied by people. Screaming triggers hallucinations and fight or flight. I do not like hearing people call my name because I think I’ll get in trouble or it is a hallucination and I get anxiety from it. I do not like hearing people walk and run or jump because I fear I’ll be attacked or that someone is out to get me. It is an endless war I am trying to fight with no weapons. Medicine only does so much and I am still working on getting support and awareness about my triggers. I don’t completely know why I get fight or flight but anything related to my episodes and abuse triggers it and usually leads to panic attacks. I don’t jump to conclusions and self diagnose but it is something I am working on communicating to doctors."
sas0002,"Visual: Seeing colors floating and forming patterns (sometimes it makes my eyes hurt because the colors are so bright but they can be pretty like fireworks), silhouettes, auras, men, shadow people, grey hands, everything looks animated, things look closer or further away, faces that look like the painting “the scream”.
Auditory: Hearing whispers, a man from the tv talking when it’s not on, hearing people scream my name, hearing family members ask random things like “sas0002 are you asleep?”
Other: This might be AIWS but anyway. A feeling that I’m bigger or smaller, a feeling that my hands or head is bigger and smaller. A feeling of things crawling on me."
[deleted],"i get mostly auditory (people yelling ""behind the wall"", just everyone yelling at each other all at once, or voices telling me bad things about me and i can't drown them out by listening to music), sometimes visual (like shadow people, one time i saw a really suspicious guy standing in the kitchen scanning my brain and i had spent 2 hours in my seat playing sudoku bc i don't think when i play it so he lost interest in me, and sometimes i see like my hands or face distorting, extra eyes in place of scars etc). very rarely i get auditory+tactile (usually phone vibrating, but sometimes i get a night visitor who sits on top of me and breathes at my face and their breath is freezing cold and i feel it even in a warm room with closed windows. funny thing though is that once i asked them to breathe quieter bc i was trying to sleep and they complied, which my therapist praised. like, he has never dismissed these things as me being crazy). that sort of thing. i think it's nothing out of the ordinary, although sometimes dead people follow me and that one gets unpleasant, but it's mostly when i'm also paranoid."
BooooBooooBoooo,"Smell hallucinations always scare me the most because I find them harder to disprove and they encourage/enhance delusions in a really insidious way.
For example as a young teen, I went through a phase when everything my parents cooked for me smelled so much like bleach I became convinced they were poisoning me."
Is-hope-distraction,"Aliens controlling people, phased subtly in an extra dimensional space around us, performing experiments. Had to end up blocking that dimensional experience out by tuning in deeply to the physical world. Medications kinda helped. A lot of it was will power though (tuning in). I hope I was just hallucinating, I really don’t know still (that was 10yrs ago). I just accepted maybe something’s up, but as I can’t do anything about it why should I concern myself with it? Best to just focus on doing what I can with what I have where I am at."
VanitysFire,The scariest hallucination I had was when I was young. I was taking a shower and the water turned to blood. The walls started melting and faces were coming out of the melting walls. Scared the shit out of me I tripped out the shower.
ihaveADHD69,hearing children crying and hearing the cries of a woman being raped
TheDollarstoreDoctor,HUGE spider. Like the size of a small dog. But once I realized it was a hallucination I saw two smaller ones and just sat on the couch frozen watching them fight.
SAMPLE_TEXT6643,I had a woman jump on my back and felt a knife to my throat. That was probably the scariest one. The most concerning one I ever had was when I was trying different meds I was talking to a guy at a Little Caesars and the cashier walked out of the back and asked me who I was talking too and the guy was gone.
theluckystrikee,Hearing a voice in the bathroom say “you’re house you’re living in is alive” over and over whilst seeing the walls move
purpleunicorns28,I thought demons were taking over the world and I was the only one who could rescue the world. And as revenge they were coming for my boyfriend and trying to kill him. I stayed up for 2-3 nights making sure he was safely asleep and “psychicly battling” the demons and ghosts. I would hold his hand everywhere we went and “fought the demons with my magic powers” It was terrible bc my bf is the one and I wanted to protect him at all costs also I thought God was against me and I had to team up with Satan and all the other “Gods” to defeat him. I could hear auditory hallucinations too. It was really scary
iHateDuckz,"I had a deadline and worked on my computer at home (during lockdown) There was a man slowly walking around my room and watching me work, he kept staring at me the whole night. He finally dissapared when it was bright outside. I have never not moved from one place for that long as that night."
warL0ck57,"In 2013, during my first full blown psychosis, I have seen my familly members beeing beheaded by terrrorists. I couldn't do anything. I was talking to aliens to help me reverse time they made me talk to satan and he ask me to kms as a sacrifice to save my familly. Never had visual hallucinations after that other then some rare occasion disturbing images flashing in front of my eyes."
Izithegrey,An old lady looking down on me as i was trying to sleep. Psychosis made me braver but im glad im out. Getting kinda scared thinking about that old lady lol and its bedtime.
trashaccountturd,"Something like an old hag or banshee type thing. Long hair, coming at me, floating very aggressively."
Cute-Avali,"Thinking my dad was behind me, trying to scare me and suddenly feeling a cold hand touching me. There was nobody behind me."
Fast-alex1,"I will never forget this. When i was about 5-6 years old i saw my mom folding clothes in the middle of the night and i was calling her name but she didn’t answer me back. When i woke up I asked her about it and she said “ I didn’t wake up in the middle of the night to fold any clothes”. ( ngl i kept asking her about it for years after that I thought she was playing with me) Another time, I was 14 years old and it was at night time when I decided to go out for a run “ inside my house” and I was so tired and I kept seeing someone staring at me like a shadowy figure but I genuinely didn’t care. My heart started racing so I decided to lay down a bit and the moment i sat on the stairs I saw the figure SO CLOSE to my face. It scared the fuck out of me suddenly everything went blank and I lost consciousness. This also happens to me multiple times. I hear women and kids crying in pain a terror screaming as hard as they could and i genuinely think it’s real i once was in dorm and i went to check on the room next to mine to make sure everything is okay."
RyverHollow,"I was working at Walmart and went to open a box only to see that my arms were coated and dripping with blood. I've also hallucinated blood coating my mother's door. Not a fan of the bloody hallucinations. I hallucinated a demon crawling at the top of my wall, looking like it was going to jump on me. It was dark green with leathery, bumpy skin, had ram horns, long pointed fingers, yellow eyes and tons of tiny sharp teeth. Literally ran out of my house for this one. Didn't come back for days. I once hallucinated a woman in my home who was in hysterics, screaming and crying, accusing me of something. I ran to my mother's room and banged on her door for aid in getting this person out of our house, but when I turned around the woman disappeared. That was intense."
Old-Move3979,"My female voice sometimes say ""I love you"" ""You're so cool"" ""darling"" ""honey""... So that's kind of positive I also get some magical sounds coming out from walls etc (things that don't make sounds) this makes me think that she is watching over me and is always with me so it's also a positive"
NotQuiteGay95,One particularly rough night I kept hallucinating men passing by my bedroom window and threatening to kill me in my sleep. That was a rough night.
ForgottenDecember_,"Several of my hallucinations are very neutral. Things like hearing the phone ring, beeping, unintelligible whispering, my name being called, vibrations, etc. Some hallucinations are negative (faces in the dark, smell of gas like my house is gonna blow up, feeling of being poisoned / having an allergic reaction, hand on my neck, etc). I’m not sure if I have any that are specifically positive, but I rarely get any sort of complex auditory or visual hallucinations. And somatic/olfactory hallucinations are usually pretty neutral. Tactile hallucinations can either be neutral or negative, never had a positive one that I can think of."
Flaky-Judge-789,I had a ring of fire around me with shadow people laughing all around me. And then the devil came up to me and shook me and screamed that I am going to hell because I have sinned. Another bizarre hallucination I have is seeing people turn into spiders and waking up to animals hanging from my ceiling and having full on conversations with them.
_newgene_,"I sometimes see shadows come alive, and I don’t know how I know but they are not benevolent spirits. The first time it happened I got stuck in a 4 hour panic attack where I thought I couldn’t move or they would kill my family. I think that one is the scariest for me"
Ok_Smell_7586,when I was trying to sleep and I felt someone crawl into my bed really quickly and saw them lay next to me
"
JPowWow",A lot of pulling and tugging. Almost like there’s strings pulling from inside my skin going up to the sky. Like I’m some marionette doll. Once I felt something pull me by my neck nobody was around. Other scary one was seeing a child at my old job run into a theater and not come out I checked the aisle nobody saw them
Buncai41,"My worst are usually ones that involve murder. I'll see the person I'm talking with get offed right in front of me or be the offender offing them. These are in no way desires I have. If the person isn't there I'll go on assuming they are dead until a very confusing encounter later. Rarely, I'm the one being attacked. I'll go to people believing I have wounds that I don't. A little less scary for me, but it scares the hell out of those around me; sometimes I'll believe I'm dead, like I look in the mirror and all I can see is a corpse. My body is perceived by me as decaying."
Impossible-Loss918,People whispering creepy things in my ear.
sunseven3,For me it was glowing white hexagon with an eye in the middle. No matter where I went in my apartment the eye itself would watch me. I was horrified.
darkwolverine96,"People in the corner of my eyes, doors opening and closing, animals in the house, cars outside, foliage, etc..."
siteroaster,"Random things like words on the wall, cute lil animals, lots of faces, an occasion decapitated head, lights, shadow people and so on."
Ihearthetrees,"Ghosts(shadow people but it's a bit different for me than what others usually describe), double of objects, lights/flashes, and bugs out of the corner of my eye."
SpoopyElvis,Usually shadowy people just standing around. I saw pigeons flying around at work for a while. Sometimes I see messages appearing on my phone but they're not actually there.
Adventurous_Scar_284,"Shadow people with big eyes sometimes they are green, sometimes they wear hats or sometimes I see tiny humans in the wall dancing and do sum crazy shit. Mostly they are just standing there watching at me, and if I speak to them they’re disappearing or acting strange, the evil ones are dark and have a strong purple aura, they are the only one’s that speaks to me, they are calling my name everytime and laughing at me. Kinda strange but most of the evil ones are females😅"
redpurewooded,Bugs. That was the worst one for me. I’d see them everywhere and though they didn’t usually crawl on me I’d see them directly in the centre of my vision and sometimes if I stared at them too long they’d disappear or turn into little beams of light. I’d also hallucinate real people like my uncle was sitting on the couch and I turned and could swear I saw him leaning over and whispering cartoonishly but there was only a lamp next to him.
darkfireice,"Luckily for me, mine usually only occur (or become an issue) when I'm severely sleep deprived and exhausted, and during the event I perceive people rapidly approach me. But as I've a had to deal with these since early childhood, I've become proficient at breaking down what I perceive versus what may be real, and so I've been able to breakdown that mostly they are random shapes that my mind interprets as people (likely from pareidolia), but when I was younger it was terrifying animal attacks (ironically I'm find my psychopathic parents beating, when I fled into thier room at night, actually aided attempts to differentiate my perception from ""reality."")"
OpiateAntagonist,"Depends how bad things are. Full blown episode? I’ll be seeing fully formed people, often without faces and often walking towards me. It’s not like some tacky cut and paste overlay, my entire reality warps. Like, You would expect that if you are walking the halucinations to move. Nope, they are like real 3d objects. Proper freaky.When things arnt too bad, it’s usually doors opening and closing, objects shifting, people in the corner of my eyes, and these weird like perspective glitches (idk how to explian but like imagine your vision just glitching). A thing I’ve noticed recently is shadow people becoming more prominent. Not like, black shadow people in 3d, but people in the shadows. Basically the shadows are like morphing and changing shape into these complex scenes, often people and faces. They can get very real, to the point where I was sat talking to one (knowing it was a hallucination but believing it was conscious) and then believing it stole a part of my consciousness. I rarely get auditory halucinations, but sometimes they join in. Most of the time the halucinations are very real and fucking terrifying, but sometimes at night I like to watch the shadows morph and move into these amazing scenes (which I couldn’t even begin to imagine, yet my brain is still doing it. Talk about using 10% of your brain!)."

Perfect_Difference15,"I get hallucinations ranging from seeing auras and swirls to seeing solid demons and feeling them choke me. It almost feels like every day has a different theme. Edit: Just remembered a particularly scary one. One day as I was leaving work I entered a dream-like state where I got on a swing out back and kinda swung a little bit in a way that felt I was hitting the ground. When I got off the swing I started walking home and re-entered reality, feeling very confused. I have no idea what I was really doing. Definitely the scariest thing I've ever experienced."
desireex3,"Brother is schizophrenic and had insane hallucinations for about a year before I could get him help. He constantly believed people were assaulting him, trying to rape him and trying to kill him. On one occasion he ran so long to get away from them he was admitted into the hospital for heat exhaustion. He didn't understand why we wouldn't help him and would lash out at us. He's now severely medicated and no where near the person he once was."
thegirlfromthestars,"One of the veins in my eye was actually a worm that was eating my brain and thats why i had headaches. Also: random sharp pains and itches are bugs crawling all over my skin, trapped in my shoes, etc. I double check my shoes every time i put them on with a flashlight but still have to take them off occasionally to check."
Dieselite,"Fortunately the scariest I've ever had is just people calling my name from another room when I know I'm the only person in the house. My audible hallucinations don't have a great vocabulary, and most of the time just sound like someone doing jazz scat, which is kind of annoying and makes it hard to sleep. Visually I'll sometimes see people standing in windows who aren't there on a second glance, or small shadows darting around like mice. I'm extremely fortunate that my symptoms are relatively mild."
Brazieroflive,"Snipers. One Friday evening I was watching TV, and happened to be playing with a flashlight that I'd left on the coffee table. Boom, next thing you know I'm in a full blown hallucination. I heard a special forces team out the window, as they were sneaking out of my back yard. I flashed the light around the room, and they got quiet, and they misunderstood my intent; they thought the light was mounted on a rifle.
Next thing you know they're calling me outside as part of a SWAT response, and I'm on my hands and knees on my porch in the dead of knight, asking them to please not shoot me. I must have stayed out there about two hours, with my hands locked behind my head, as the snipers got more and more nervous about what I might do.
Eventually they decided that there was no way to defuse the situation, and they shot me. I spent about five minutes laying dead on my front porch, then crawled inside my house to die. I phoned my mom to let her know that I'd been shot and that special forces had killed me. Needless to say she wasn't buying it, and talked me down to earth a little bit, but that wasn't the end of it.
She had me go to the ER, and stayed with me on the phone until I got there. I'm still in full blown hallucination mode, so while I'm waiting in the ER I hear the leader of the special forces unit chatting with the front desk nurse. He knows that I'm there, and is coming to get me. Luckily the doctor found me first, and didn't really know what to do with me, so he gave me 2 milligrams of Ativan and discharged me.
So I drive home, still hallucinating and now somewhat high from the Ativan, and I see all types of crazy stuff on the way home. Once I get home the Ativan mellows the hallucinations into something enjoyable, and I spend the rest of the weekend with playful hallucinations.
I can't really describe the fear of having special forces snipers aiming at you for two hours straight"
Guyæaughingwithsalad,"Hey everyone. Schizophrenic here. I’d rather not specify a specific type. I’m diagnosed with the paranoid kind, but I do show symptoms of a few other types from what I can tell.
Either way, my scariest hallucinations are the ones that make me feel like the fabric of spacetime is ripping. I have a few that fall into that category.
The most common one (which scares the shit out of me) is when I can see individual cells disappearing from existence, popping like balloons, not being replaced by new ones. I feel as though reality itself is dissolving and becoming a liquid substance, of sorts. It’s as if everything is kinda magnified, I see much clearer when this is happening, which is unusual since my medication tends to blur my vision.
Another less common one is feeling like everything in the universe is being drawn towards me involuntarily, being absorbed by my body and being unable to ever leave. I basically feel like I’m non-figuratively a black hole, which is terrifying and sad and oddly serene at the same time."
Epicdoomcow,"Out of all the various recurring, excruciating delusions of pain, death, and extreme paranoia, few have come to scare me as much as this one. Buckle up, folks.
I'm awoken, the night sky illuminated by a half moon. Outside my window, possibly a reflection, a face looks back at me. Bearded, helmeted, looks kinda like those biker zombies from 7 Days to Die, to give a better picture. The face contorts and twists and turns and goes inside out, then back to normal. Looks like it's laughing now. Starts moving towards me. Through the window.
Now inside my bedroom, not three solid turds from my face, laughing. I scream silently, too afraid to make a sound, to even blink. The face hovers, menacingly staring deep into my soul, and shredding it to pieces. In a rare moment of clarity, I start praying to every god I know, from Jesus to Odin to Krishna to Osiris and back, begging for mercy, please, anything but this!
The face then loses its face, becomes a skull. A bastardized mix of human and cow that is hard to describe with words. It had horns. It was horrifying. I thought -- I knew -- I was going to die. This laughing skull was going to kill me. In a final act of malice, it crept towards me, staring deeper and deeper into my eyes, further shredding and searing my soul with its pure hatred. I closed my eyes for the first time in ages, and when I opened them, it was gone. Looking around, my alarm clock displayed 3:04 am. The half moon a sideways frown, reminding me that I was in danger. That the skull, the face, it was sent here, to hurt and kill me. I didn't sleep again for another two days, and even then, I had almost collapsed from exhaustion.
That's the end of that memory. As painful as it is to relive, it is important, because it reminds my if why I take my meds: to never be afraid of things like that again"
TheSwindle,"A demon appeared on a door on my balcony and said “you can’t help me no one can help me.” When i went inside it moved up the wall onto the ceiling and said that it was coming back in two minutes to take me to hell. I started feeling a pulsing move up my left arm which led me to think i was going to have a heart attack. It came back and i was so scared that i ran out of my apartment. What followed was a situation that lasted in real life only about two days, but the timeline in the delusion lasted six months. At some point during the night the cops tazed me about 10 miles from the house and my heart ended up stopping. In the delusion the demon had captured me and taken me to hell where i was chained and being forced to smash my head into a glass wall. In real life i was in someone’s backyard trying to bash my head through their sliding glass door. Apparently the owner of the house tried to shoot me with a shotgun but missed. At some point i was too tired in the delusion and fell to the ground. The demon continually told me that this was only going to get worse if i didnt continue. I had no energy so i gave up. Two zombie looking doberman’s came and ate my entire body from the neck down until i was nothing but bone. I watched my muscles and skin slowly grow back until i was whole and was told to continue smashing the window with my head. The window broke and i fell onto the bottom pane which cut me in half. I immediately was transported into a room that was unbearably hot. Each breath i took was a gasp and i coudnt get any air. There was someone in front of me holding a glass of water with condensation on it, but i only had enough strength to barely crawl towards it. Every time i got close enough to touch the glass the person took a step back. There was a clock on the wall and i watched six months go by. The only thought i had for this entire delusion was “i am never getting out of here.” No thoughts of my family or the past just endless despair about never getting out. Eventually i got close enough and when my fingers touched the glass i was transported to another place. It was a void where there stood a massive black dragon with bright green eyes. The undersides of his wings were the same bright green. He moved his head towards me, which was about three times the size of my entire body, and whispered “it is only going to get worse from here.” Then he spewed a black smoke from his nostrils that entered my ear. The next thing I experienced can only be described like this: imagine having 5000 copies of yourself that are all having the most intense mind-splitting migraine that you could never imagine, but all those minds are happening inside of your mind. I lost all sense of existence in the pain. Then i was in space staring at the earth and in my own voice i heard the words “ you created all of this.” Then i woke up and was strapped into a hospital bed in the ICU. I looked like someone had dragged me behind a car naked; just covered in gashes and wounds. For a long time i was completely traumatized, but those last words actually have changed my entire life. I know now that my entire reality is created by my mind and knowing that i no longer fear anything. I think that when people die they release a huge amount of dmt which causes a time dilated dream state. Depending on what you were thinking before death, in my case going to hell, that is exactly what happens. From the time i saw the demon to when i woke up only two days went by but i was in hell for 6 months. I have one more story that happened more recently and i’ll put it here if anyone wants to hear it"
Hunter0988 ,"I’ve had a reoccurring figure since my episodes first started. When I was younger I would hear brief whispered statements like “hey” or “look”. The first time this specific voice turned into a visual sensation I was around 13 years old, I was reading in bed and I heard a whisper saying “stop” that kept repeating louder and louder to the point of screaming. Slowly coming into my field of vision was a woman in a white robe, a disfigured bloody old face and mangled hair. When she was fully there, the screaming stopped. It felt like an eternity of being unable I to look away because I was petrified. My eyes just kept watering. After a few minutes I was able to snap out of the trance and she was gone.
I’ve struggled with other episodes but this is one of my few reoccurring terrors. In school she would appear in class, I’d be out with my friends and she’d be in the road, I’d be at work and she’s just there. It’s caused issues in relationships because I have a hard time admitting I go through with this. A month ago I was visiting my ex girlfriend at her dorm, and I woke up paralyzed with fear because I was experiencing an episode but couldn’t reach out for help.
Sometimes I worry that I’ll have to deal with this alone until I can’t handle the dread anymore"
BooooBooooBoooo,"Smell hallucinations always scare me the most because I find them harder to disprove and they encourage/enhance delusions in a really insidious way.
For example as a young teen, I went through a phase when everything my parents cooked for me smelled so much like bleach I became convinced they were poisoning me"
Is-hope-distraction,"Aliens controlling people, phased subtly in an extra dimensional space around us, performing experiments.
Had to end up blocking that dimensional experience out by tuning in deeply to the physical world.
Medications kinda helped. A lot of it was will power though (tuning in).
I hope I was just hallucinating, I really don’t know still (that was 10yrs ago). I just accepted maybe something’s up, but as I can’t do anything about it why should I concern myself with it?
Best to just focus on doing what I can with what I have where I am at."
VanitysFire,The scariest hallucination I had was when I was young. I was taking a shower and the water turned to blood. The walls started melting and faces were coming out of the melting walls. Scared the shit out of me I tripped out the shower.
TheDollarstoreDoctor,HUGE spider. Like the size of a small dog. But once I realized it was a hallucination I saw two smaller ones and just sat on the couch frozen watching them fight.
Flaky-Judge-789,"
I had a ring of fire around me with shadow people laughing all around me. And then the devil came up to me and shook me and screamed that I am going to hell because I have sinned. Another bizarre hallucination I have is seeing people turn into spiders and waking up to animals hanging from my ceiling and having full on conversations with them"
_newgene_,"I sometimes see shadows come alive, and I don’t know how I know but they are not benevolent spirits. The first time it happened I got stuck in a 4 hour panic attack where I thought I couldn’t move or they would kill my family. I think that one is the scariest for me"
QuantumPerspectives,"My first was seeing “energy”. What I was seeing was correct, cloudy and smoggy looking electricity are around tvs or laptops. It would move more freely in the open, but I could manipulate it too. Feathers had strong streams of energy coming from them, I could feel it with my hands.
Angry energy looked like sharp jagged lines. Energy around salt lamps was neutralized and harmonious. People sparkled and I thought it was every time they had a good idea… I’m still not totally convinced that I was seeing hallucinations or just into a more sensitive parallel reality. I’m on meds though."
Swimming_Fox9090,my very first visual hallucination was a guy sucking his own dick. He saw me & freaked out trying to run away. My craziest auditory hallucination was when the voices were telling me there was a man who would come into my room every night while I was asleep to eat my toes. Scared the shit out of me
SonderShaman,When I was in college I was trying to go to bed one night and I heard a whole baseball game outside my house. There was an announcer and a crowd cheering but there was no stadium near me. It was very surreal.
deleted,The craziest shit I’ve ever been told by the voices was the aliens were spying on me specifically. Guess im just that important.
lilbitunstabl,Before meds there was one time I kept seeing my face appear in the faces i was watching on tv and it freaked me out and i started to panic and the words started to get jumbled to the point i couldnt hear anything anymore besides noise and this yellow caution tape started to go around the room telling me it was just my anxiety acting up and to breathe and as soon as i regulated my breathing it went away. Weirdest hallucination I have ever had.
Lecckie,"It was my first real 'something is very wrong in my head' moment. Happened like, 6 months ago I believe. I was out in the woods with my classmates, we were doing this like, senior day of service thing. I was farther back from the group a bit, since I didnt really know anyone in the group. After a bit of just looking around, the thicker roots in the ground started slithering like tendrils, and the trees grew eyes. I have never been so scared in my life."
